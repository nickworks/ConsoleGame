//TODO: add elevators

== experience map ==

1. movement & combat
2. lookup a random door code
3. change an enemy to friendly
4. activate a door/elevator
5. change the camera target to something else (a steerable projectile?)
6. spawn items (keys, platforms, etc)
7. (discover functions)
8. (read and change a function)

== kinds of callbacks ==

= NPC=
onSpeak
onDeath

= Platform =

= Door = 
onOpen
onClose


== How do we PROTECT/SANDBOX elements? ==

hide objects in places other than the game
    document.levelGoal={x:100,y:200,draw:function(gfx){}};

for immutable state, we could "store" in a function...
    function ScenePlay(){
        this.goal=()=>return{x:100,y:200};
    }

what about local vars?
    function ScenePlay(){
        var goal={x:100,y:200};//can we access externally?
    }
    function ScenePlay(goal){
    
    }
